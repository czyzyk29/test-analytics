Test Analytics is a web application that allows rapid generation of a project's ACC model -- an alterative to a test plan that is faster to create and of more practical value.  This decomposition of the product allows a easy way to visualize project risk across project capabilities.  In addition, Test Analytics supports importing quality signals -- tests, code changes, and bugs -- to quantify risk and map it across your project's model.  This gives a bird's eye view of the risk associated with all areas of your project, and a way to assess what portions of your project need additional testing.

To learn more about the ACC methodology and how it works, see AccExplained.  It explains how to create an ACC breakdown of your project, as well as the benefits of doing so.
